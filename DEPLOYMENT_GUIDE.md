### **2. Sample Test Content:**
```
Sales Rep: Hi John, thanks for scheduling this consultation about your marriage.

John: Yeah, we've been having some real problems lately. My wife and I just can't seem to communicate anymore.

Sales Rep: I understand that must be really frustrating. Can you tell me more about what specific communication challenges you're facing?

John: Well, every conversation turns into an argument. She thinks I don't listen to her, and honestly, maybe she's right. I just don't know how to fix it anymore. We've tried talking about it ourselves, but it just makes things worse.

Sales Rep: It sounds like you're both really trying, which shows you care about your relationship. Many couples face exactly what you're describing. When did you first notice these communication patterns starting?
```

### **3. Expected Real Results:**
